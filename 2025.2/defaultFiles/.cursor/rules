# HubSpot Project Components Rules

## Project Structure
- Project configuration is in `hsproject.json` file
- Source directory is defined in `srcDir` field in `hsproject.json`
- Platform version is defined in `platformVersion` in `hsproject.json`
- Components must be in project source directory only

## Component Configuration
- Component configuration files must end with `-hsmeta.json`
- `uid` field must be unique within the project
- `type` field defines the component type
- Components cannot be in nested subdirectories
- Follow directory structure based on component type

## Component Types and Directory Rules

### app component
- Only one `app` component allowed
- Must be in `app` directory
- If `config.distribution` is `marketplace`, only `oauth` auth type is valid

### card component
- Must be in `app/cards` directory
- Cannot use `window.fetch`, and instead must use the `hubspot.fetch` function provided by the `@hubspot/ui-extensions` npm package.  Any urls called with the `hubspot.fetch` function must be added to the `config.permittedUrls.fetch` array in the `app` component's hsmeta.json file
- Only components exported from the `@hubspot/ui-extensions` npm package can be used in `card` components

### app-function component
- Must be in `app/functions` directory
- Not available when `config.distribution` is `marketplace`

### settings component
- Only one `settings` component allowed
- Must be in `app/settings` directory
- Cannot use `window.fetch`, and instead must use the `hubspot.fetch` function provided by the `@hubspot/ui-extensions` npm package.  Any urls called with the `hubspot.fetch` function must be added to the `config.permittedUrls.fetch` array in the `app` component's hsmeta.json file
- Only components exported from the `@hubspot/ui-extensions` npm package can be used in `settings` components

### webhooks component
- Only one `webhooks` component allowed
- Must be in `app/webhooks` directory
- Only available when `config.distribution` is `private` and `config.auth.type` is `static`

### workflow-action component
- Must be in `app/workflow-actions` directory

## HubSpot CLI Commands
- Use `hs project` subcommands for project management
- Use `--help` for command details
- Use `--debug` flag for debugging
- Use `hs doctor` for CLI installation issues
- Use `hs project open` to open project in browser
- Use `hs init` to set up configuration
- Use `hs auth` to authenticate accounts
- Use `hs account` subcommands for account management

## Best Practices
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Use proper component structure based on `type` field
- Follow HubSpot naming conventions
- Validate components are in correct directories
